# React Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio utilizing React and Vite.
- I built this project to display information about myself and showcase previous work.
- This code is effective in displaying skillsets and information about the developer.
- Composing this project, I learned how to use Vite and React- even with the roadbumps along the way.
